It is half stream-of-conciousness and half additional notes taken during a clubhouse room several months ago. Bitcoin Entropy \u00b6 Statistical Thermodynamic Entropy \\(S\\) is defined by the total number of potential (micro-)states of a system, \\(\\Omega\\) times Boltzmann's constant. \\[ S = k_B ln(\\Omega) \\] \\[ k_B = 1.38064852 \u00d7 10-23 [m^2kg/s^2K] \\] In proof of work, miners look for any number (the Nonce) that generates a hash with a specific number of leading 0s. The difficutlty is given by \\[ \\Omega = D * 2^{48}/ \\alpha_c \\] \\[ \\alpha_c = 65535 = 0XFFFF \\] Where the numeric constant alpha is given by the hex value above. Let each hash guess be a microstrostate of the system, and the number of such possible microstates is given by the current mining difficulty. As a result, we can define Bitcoin Entropy \\(S_{BTC}\\) \\[ S_{BTC}(D) = k_B ln(D 2^{48} / \\alpha_c) = k_B ln(D) + const \\] However, Bitcoin's difficulty is not constant, but adjusts every 2 weeks. The change in difficulty, \\(\\Delta D\\) results in a change in Entropy \\(\\Delta S_{BTC}\\) . Taking the derivative \\(S_{BTC}(D)\\) with respective to difficulty drops the above constant, yielding \\[ \\Delta S_{BTC}(\\Delta D) = k_B \\Delta D/D ... \\] Bitcoin Enthalpy \u00b6 Enthalpy \\(H\\) is given by the internal energy \\(E\\) and the environmental pressure \\(PV\\) $$ H = E + PV $$ In most chemical reactions we would be interested in just the change in enthalpy, and approximatations may be made about the environment (constant pressure, work done is due to changes in volume only) \\[ \\Delta H = q + w + P \\Delta V = q + -P\\Delta V + P \\Delta V = q \\] Heat \\(q\\) energy that flows due to a difference in temperature. q is negative if heat is being released by the system. Heat always flows spontaneously from high temperature to low temperature. When temperature and pressure are constant: \\(q= \\Delta H\\) the change in enthalpy. Enthalpy of a chemical reaction measured in \\(\\pm kJ/mol\\) However Bitcoin mining incentivizes all forms of energy production. Just as there are many chemical processes that may absorb heat from an environment there are many physical processes that may result in mining. Stranded natural gas, geothermal, hydroelectric, wind, and solar have all been used as sources of energy production. Each of these has varying degrees of efficiency, but we can assume such efficiencies are constant relative to the 2-week period of difficulty adjustment. So we may consider such sources \"upstream\" of the mining operation and only consider the energy able to be leveraged in hash rate. Recall Exothermic - releases energy into the environment Endothermic - absorbs energy from the environment \\(H\\) -Enthalpy is the internal energy of a system \\(\\Delta H\\) Change in enthalpy of a system In Bitcoin, we are interested in the total energy put and released from bitcoin mining, which is proporational to the current hash rate times the efficiency of the mining process. Note The hashrate itself is not directly measureable, but is proporational to difficulty. As the bitcoin network grows, we have seen more and more energy being absorbed by bitcoin mining, so the system is clearly endothermic over long time scales. When the hashrate reduces, however, the energy available to mining may be reallocated elsewhere. Gibbs Free Energy \u00b6 In Thermite, if the reactants have more energy than the surrounding system, then one might expect a sponanteous reaction to occur. However, there are chemical reactions like Ice packs that occur sponanteous and pull energy from the environment. To understand whether a system is set up for spontaneous reaction, we need to take into account Entropy as well as Enthalpy. The Gibbs Free Energy relates Enthalpy, \\(\\Delta H\\) , Temperature \\(T\\) and Entropy \\(\\Delta S\\) to determine the energy available to work. \\[ \\Delta G = \\Delta H - T \\Delta S \\] This is the energy available to do work in a physical propcess. It determines whether a system is spontaneous or non-spontaneous reaction placeholder \\(\\Delta H < 0\\) \\(\\Delta H > 0\\) \\(\\Delta S > 0\\) Spontaneous Spontaneous at High Temperature \\(\\Delta S < 0\\) Spontaneous at Low Temperature Not Spontaneous What about in between? \\[ 0 = \\Delta H - T \\Delta S \\] \\[ \\Delta H = T \\Delta S \\] What does this tell us about Bitcoin's difficulty adjustment?

Most of the article hinges on the following ... no matter how much electricity is poured into Bitcoin, the output is always the same \u2014 6.25 Bitcoin per 10 minutes. And while the value of 6.25 Bitcoin is not fixed but fluctuating, the fluctuations have nothing to do with the price of electricity. In a battery, the more electricity you put in, the more you\u2019ll get out. In Bitcoin, the output is constant regardless of the amount of electricity you put in. What the author says is somewhat true in aggregate , but only in regards to the block reward - it doesn't include fees, which we expect to be more significant over time. Further it is not true for individual miners and over shorter periods of time. This is because the miner's reward is proportional to the amount of electricity expendenture relative to that of other miners . As a result, the amount of economic potential received by the miner is actually proportional to the amount of energy they expend (which is the opposite of what the author claims). I use the term \"economic potential\" because I do agree that bitcoin is not literally a battery in the sense that BTC units are not the same as physical units of energy (the Joule), but they are related: the mining process converts physical energy into economic potential energy . As a savings instrument, Bitcoin acts like a battery, able store economic potential until it can be released into the economy as a money. From that perspective, money is the kenetic form of economic energy while savings is the potential form - both have the same monetary unit, but they represent different forms of it. While we're on the topic of batteries, to say that \"Bitcoin is not a battery\" is like saying that voltage is not the same as current - while true, it ignores the physical relationship between the two. Consider Ohm's Law: \\[ V = IR \\] The voltage \\(V\\) is the electric potential (in units of J/Coulomb) between two points in a classical electric circuit. The Current \\(I\\) is the kinetic form of charge (measured in Coulombs/sec). We are not saying that Voltage and Current are the same, but that they are related by a factor proportional to the resistance \\(R\\) (the difficulty in moving charge). This may seem like a simple and obvious formula today but Ohm's law was quite controversial in it's time as well . Like Bitcoin, it was several years before Ohm's law was recognized for the law of nature that it is.","title":"Economic Energy"},{"location":"EconomicPotential/#re-bitcoin-is-not-a-battery","text":"Henry Magram @henrymagram kindly pointed me to an article by Elad Verbin, \"Bitcoin is not a battery - it is a Sink\" and asked what I thought of it.
